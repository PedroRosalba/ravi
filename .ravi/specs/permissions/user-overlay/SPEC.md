# Chat-Scoped User Overlay

## Intent

A contact/user permission grant is scoped to a **chat** by default. The user
overlay narrows what the executor agent does for that contact in that chat; it
never widens the agent.

For a resolved contact speaking in a governed chat:

```text
effective_capabilities =
  agent_identity_capabilities           -- executor agent ceiling
  INTERSECT contact_chat_capabilities   -- grants covering (contact, chat)
  INTERSECT turn_capabilities_when_present
```

Agent identity remains the primary authority path
(`permissions/agent-identity`). The overlay is an additional branch on top of
it, not a replacement.

## Grant Scopes

A contact grant links one contact to one permission profile in exactly one
scope:

| Scope | CLI | Covers |
|-------|-----|--------|
| `chat:<chat-id>` | `--chat <chat-id\|current>` | one canonical chat and every thread inside it |
| `chat-tag:<tag>` | `--chat-tag <tag>` | every chat currently carrying that chat tag |
| `global` | `--force` | every chat (legacy contact permission tag) |

- Chat and chat-tag grants MUST be stored in the provider-owned
  `permission_contact_chat_grants` table in `ravi.db`, keyed by
  `(contact_id, profile_slug, scope_type, scope_id)`. The table is consumed only
  by `contact-policy-permissions`; it is not a generic relation graph.
- Grants MUST reference a profile by slug. Capabilities MUST be read from the
  profile (provider-owned `permission-*` tag definition) at materialization
  time, so editing a profile updates every grant that references it.
- Global grants MUST remain the existing contact permission tag
  (`kind=system`, `source=permissions`) attached to the contact.
- Chat grants MUST be keyed on the canonical chat id. A platform chat id MAY be
  accepted as input and resolved to the canonical id before storage.

## Threads

- Threads MUST inherit their container chat's grants. There is no separate
  thread grant model.
- A thread chat is a chat whose `normalized_chat_id` is
  `<container-normalized-id>#<thread-id>` on the same channel and instance.
- `--chat <thread-id>` MUST store the grant on the container chat and report
  the thread in the structured result (`threadChatId`) and hints.
- A turn in a thread MUST resolve grants against the container chat and record
  `userOverlayThreadChat` in context metadata.

## Governance

A chat is **governed** when at least one contact grant covers it: a direct
chat grant for any contact, or a chat-tag grant whose tag the chat carries.

- In an ungoverned chat the overlay MUST NOT change authority. The turn keeps
  the agent-identity path (`agent_identity ∩ turn_caps`) exactly as before.
- In a governed chat, the overlay MUST gate every resolved contact sender:
  - a sender with covering grants receives
    `agent_identity ∩ contact_chat_caps (∩ turn_caps)`;
  - a sender with no covering grant receives zero tool capabilities
    (chat-only behavior for that sender in that chat).
- Global contact grants (`--force`) contribute capabilities only inside
  governed chats. A global grant alone MUST NOT govern a chat, so legacy global
  contact tags do not change ungoverned chats.
- Blocked or opted-out contacts, and contacts that no longer exist, MUST
  receive zero overlay capabilities in a governed chat.
- Explicit chat and chat-tag grants MUST NOT require
  `contact_policies.status=allowed` (group participants are often
  `discovered`/`pending`). Global contact permission tags keep the legacy
  `allowed` requirement (`permissions/tag-policy`). Status never implies
  capabilities by itself.
- Only contact actors on chat surfaces are overlaid. Automation, agent, and
  unresolved actors keep their existing paths (unresolved actors still fail
  closed).
- Task-self capabilities (`task-runtime:self:*`) MUST survive the overlay so a
  task session can still report on its own task.
- The executor agent ceiling MUST bound the result. A `chat-only` agent MUST
  still produce zero tool capabilities regardless of contact grants.

## Enforcement And Freshness

- The overlay MUST be resolved at turn start and persisted in the turn's
  capability snapshot. Every enforcement point that reads the snapshot
  (context-capabilities provider, CLI command access, host tool
  authorization) enforces it without extra wiring.
- The Bash/tool PreToolUse hook normally re-reads the live executor ceiling
  for resolved agent-identity turns. For `actorAuthorizationMode=user-overlay`
  turns it MUST require both the issued snapshot and the live ceiling, so the
  live ceiling can narrow the overlay but never replace it.
- `ravi permissions deny --apply` MUST revoke live runtime contexts whose
  `userOverlayGrants` contain the revoked `<profile>@<scope>` for that contact,
  like `ravi agents permissions` does for agent reductions.
- New grants, chat-tag changes, and a first grant that makes a chat governed
  apply from the next turn. In-flight turns of other senders keep their
  snapshot until they end.

## Runtime Context Metadata

When the actor is a contact on a chat surface, the turn context MUST record:

- `actorAuthorizationMode=user-overlay` when the overlay gated the turn
  (otherwise the existing `invoke-only` / `not-applicable`);
- `userOverlay`: `active` or `inactive`;
- `userOverlayChat`: `chat:<container-chat-id>`;
- `userOverlayThreadChat`: `chat:<thread-chat-id>` for thread turns;
- `userOverlayGrants`: `<profile>@<scope>` list when active;
- `userOverlayEligible=false` when active and the contact is blocked/opted
  out/missing;
- `actorCapabilityCount`: overlay capability count when active, else `0`.

Materialized overlay capabilities MUST carry provenance:

- `contact-policy:contact:<id>:chat:<chat-id>:profile:<slug>`
- `contact-policy:contact:<id>:chat-tag:<tag>:profile:<slug>`
- `contact-policy:contact:<id>:tag:<slug>` (global)
- `contact-policy:contact:<id>:admin-tag` (compatibility admin tags)

Audit provenance MUST carry `userOverlay`, `userOverlayChat`,
`userOverlayThreadChat`, and `userOverlayGrants` when present.

## Denials

A denial from an overlay-gated turn MUST be diagnosed as
`user_overlay_missing_grant` and MUST recommend a chat-scoped grant:

```bash
ravi permissions allow <profile> --to contact:<actor-id> --chat <chat-id> \
  --agent <executor-agent-id> --capabilities <permission>:<objectType>:<objectId>
```

`ravi permissions resolve <denial-id>` for such a denial MUST infer
`contact:<actor-id>`, the denied chat, and the executor agent, and plan a grant
scoped to that chat. An explicit `--chat`, `--chat-tag`, or `--force` replaces
the inferred scope; `resolve` MUST NOT go global without `--force`.

## CLI Contract

```bash
ravi permissions allow <profile> --to contact:<id> --chat <chat-id|current> [--agent <id>] [--apply]
ravi permissions allow <profile> --to contact:<id> --chat-tag <tag> [--agent <id>] [--apply]
ravi permissions allow <profile> --to contact:<id> --force [--apply]
ravi permissions deny  <profile> --to contact:<id> (--chat <chat> | --chat-tag <tag> | --force) [--apply]
ravi permissions list  [--to contact:<id>] (--chat <chat> | --chat-tag <tag> | --force) [--profile <p>]
```

Rules:

- `allow`, `deny`, and `list` targeting contacts MUST require exactly one scope
  kind: `--chat` and/or `--chat-tag`, or `--force`. Without a scope they MUST
  refuse with code `CHAT_SCOPE_REQUIRED` (exit 2) before any mutation. The
  error MUST list accepted flags and, when a current chat is known, suggest
  `--chat <current-chat-id>`.
- `--force` combined with `--chat`/`--chat-tag` MUST fail with `USAGE_ERROR`.
- `--chat`/`--chat-tag`/`--force` without any contact target on `allow` MUST
  fail with `USAGE_ERROR`; agent-only `allow` keeps its existing contract.
- `deny` MUST accept only `contact:<id>` targets.
- `--chat current` MUST resolve from the current runtime context; outside a
  chat it MUST fail.
- `allow` MUST reject an unknown chat (`CHAT_NOT_FOUND`); an ambiguous
  platform chat id MUST fail with `CHAT_AMBIGUOUS`.
- Unknown contacts MUST fail with `CONTACT_NOT_FOUND` before any mutation.
- `allow` and `deny` MUST dry-run by default and persist only with `--apply`.
- `--force` MUST emit a hint that the safer default is a specific chat/group,
  so the agent asks the human first (e.g. "only in this group?").
- `allow` SHOULD hint when a chat becomes governed (other senders lose tool
  access there), when a thread was mapped to its container chat, and when no
  `--agent` ceiling was ensured.
- `deny` SHOULD hint when grants in other scopes still cover the contact and
  when a chat stops being governed.

### Structured Confirmation

`allow`, `deny`, and `list` JSON output MUST include a `confirmation` object:

```json
{
  "action": "allow",
  "dryRun": false,
  "contacts": ["contact:<id>"],
  "agents": ["agent:<id>"],
  "scopes": ["chat:<chat-id>"],
  "global": false,
  "force": false,
  "profile": "permission-<slug>",
  "capabilities": ["<permission>:<objectType>:<objectId>"],
  "message": "Granted permission-<slug> to contact:<id> only in chat:<chat-id> (not global)."
}
```

- `scopes` MUST be `chat:<id>`, `chat-tag:<tag>`, or `global`.
- `global` MUST be `true` only when `--force` was used.
- `list` MUST also return `grants[]` (`contact`, `profile`, `scope`,
  `scopeType`, `source`, `capabilities`) and, for chat scopes, `overlays[]`
  (`contact`, `chat`, `governed`, `eligible`, `capabilities`).

## Known Limits

- Merging contacts does not move chat grants; grants on the merged-away
  contact stop applying (fail closed).
- Chat-tag coverage is evaluated at turn time; tagging or untagging a chat
  changes coverage on the next turn without touching grants.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Contact `allow`/`deny`/`list` without `--chat`, `--chat-tag`, or `--force`
  is refused with `CHAT_SCOPE_REQUIRED` and writes nothing.
- A chat-scoped grant gives the contact
  `agent_identity ∩ profile_caps` only in that chat.
- A chat-tag grant covers every chat carrying the tag.
- A thread turn uses its container chat's grants.
- Contact capabilities outside the executor agent ceiling never materialize.
- `--force` creates a global grant, reports `global=true`, `force=true`, and
  emits the safer-default hint.
- Structured confirmation reports subject, scope, profile, capabilities, and
  force for allow, deny, and list.
- Ungoverned chats keep the agent-identity result unchanged.
